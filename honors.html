    <h2>Focus Area/Capstone</h2>
    <div id="capstone">
        <p>I intend to complete a focus area and capstone related to entrepreneurship. I’d like to create something in the realm of software, 
            but I’m not sure what yet. One idea is a sort of business where I’d help current students put together a personal website – when applying to 
            jobs and internships, it’s beneficial to have a sort of online portfolio of your work, but unless you know how to code, it can be 
            expensive to acquire one. Another idea (and the one I’m most excited about for now), is creating some sort of advice bot for new students. 
            It’s overwhelming trying to choose classes, especially when you don’t even know your major yet, and I’ve heard from a lot of students that 
            they really struggled to find what they’re passionate about doing because there are so many options to parse through. I’m thinking I’d call the 
            program ‘Roomie’ (because it’s like a helpful ‘roommate’). It would ask the user questions about potential majors, things they’re interested in, 
            etc, and advise them on what classes might work best. Down the line, it could help with other things, like student orgs and even finding internships, 
            but for now, I think the scope of classes (or maybe just engineering classes to start), is most achievable.</p>
