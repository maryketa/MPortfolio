    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div id="about">
        <div id="paragraphs">
            <p>My name is Mary Keta, and I'm currently a third year undergraduate student. I study Computer Science at the University of Michigan, and I’m minoring in Creative Writing. As a 
                result of this combination, I’ve come to love the creative side of software development – I really enjoy coming up with innovative algorithms and solutions that 
                work behind-the-scenes. 
                In the future, I’m looking for a software engineering role where I can challenge myself to create, to do things that haven't been done before. Specifically, I’m very interested 
                in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I’d love to take on some sort of an entrepreneurial role in these areas. I love working with people and I seek out 
                opportunities to act as a leader.</p>
            <p>
                Outside of classes, I spend a lot of my free time doing anything music-related. Whether it be writing melodies with my guitar or singing songs way out of my range on 
                karaoke night, music is a large part of my identity. I'm also a big fan of video games, and last summer, I built a gaming PC that I'm currently using to create this site.
                Sometime before I graduate, I'm hoping to take a class where I can learn the basics of video game development. Some other random facts: I'm a huge Marvel movie fan, my favorite band is 
                Panic! at the Disco, and I play a bit of Dungeons and Dragons. These things don't have much to do with my career; I just think they're fun, so I figured I'd share them here.

            <h3>Multidisciplinary Design Team</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>In January of 2020, I joined a design team for class credit through my university. A large part of
                our project is the development of a web application. Essentially, the app allows users to draw a picture, then generates
                a piece of music based on the colors, shapes, and position of brush strokes in the drawing. After a semester of work, I was offered a
                summer fellowship to continue work on this project, specifically on the web app. I participated in this fellowship for six
                weeks in the spring of 2020. In that time, I worked on the design and development of the app's 
                user interface. I also assisted with the creation of the algorithm that transformed the drawing into music.
                Web development was fairly new to me, so I spent this time learning new
                skills and immediately applying them to the project. To complete the design successfully, it was
                necessary to make quick decisions regarding which features to prioritize. When making these
                decisions, I remained calm under pressure and used my creative thinking skills to develop an
                easy-to-use and aesthetically pleasing interface. The app is currently going through user testing and can be found <a href="http://68.62.72.63">here</a>.

            <h3>General Motors Internship</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2020, I was an intern at General Motors on the Vehicle Systems Cybersecurity
                team. My main task was the development of a program that extracts, filters, and analyzes vital
                data from error log files, condensing millions of lines of data into readable error reports of a few
                hundred lines long. This program is currently being used in multiple manufacturing plants in Michigan. 
                Because my internship was mainly virtual, my work was very self-directed.
                While working from home, I used my time efficiently and remained ahead of schedule. When I
                had space in my calendar, I reached out to my superiors to get involved with additional projects. One of these 
                projects was the redesigning of a safety awareness SharePoint site, which is currently being used to deliver 
                vital safety information to hundreds of GM employees.

            <h3>Creative Writing Minor</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I decided to minor in creative writing simply because I find it fun. I love telling stories and entertaining others,
                and I figured the minor would be a great opportunity to improve these skills. I currently have a portfolio of short stories,
                and I'm working on writing a novel. By taking on this minor, I've improved my creative thinking and communication skills. I'm 
                finding these things to be very helpful in the world of engineering as well; I'm learning to effectively share my ideas, in class
                and in a work environment.

            <h3>Sorority Leadership</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I'm a member of Phi Sigma Rho, a social sorority of engineers. My current position is Scholarship Chair, which means
                I'm in charge of the more academic-centered things our sorority does. I organize and host various study-related events
                throughout the semester, and I plan a career fair prep event that helps attendees prepare their resumes
                and elevator pitches before the career fair. Holding this position requires time management and organizational skills,
                creativity when planning events, and the leadership skills to host entertaining and informational events.
                I'm also responsible for ensuring all members meet our sorority's GPA requirements. If someone is not meeting these requirements,
                I have a conversation with them and make a plan to get them back on track. In fulfilling this responsibility, I've learned to have
                difficult conversations tactfully and to handle sensitive information responsibly.
